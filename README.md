# Minimax Projects

This is a WIP repository containing projects that I want to make a bot for using the Minimax algorithm. Currently, I have fully implemented the Chess game and have started work on the bot script.

## Installation and Running
I will soon put out a build for the chess game, but before that, you can download the source code and import the project using the Unity Hub with version [2022](https://unity.com/releases/2022-lts). You can then run this the same as any Unity project.
